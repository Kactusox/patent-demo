## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Security
- ⚠️ Passwords stored in plaintext (should use bcrypt)
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on login attempts
- ⚠️ No session timeout
- ⚠️ XLSX library has known vulnerabilities (low risk - admin only)

See `SECURITY.md` for details and mitigation strategies.

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Backend (.env)
```env
PORT=5001                    # Change if port is in use

## 🚀 Deployment Recommendations

### Before Production Deployment:
1. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Add rate limiting (express-rate-limit)
   - Enable HTTPS (reverse proxy with SSL)
   - Change all default passwords
   - Review SECURITY.md recommendations

2. **Performance**
   - Build frontend for production: `npm run build`
   - Serve built files with Express or nginx
   - Enable gzip compression
   - Set up CDN for static assets (optional)

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up logging (winston or bunyan)
   - Configure error tracking (Sentry)
   - Set up uptime monitoring
   - Configure automated backups

4. **Database**
   - Regular backups of patent_system.db
   - Consider PostgreSQL for production
   - Index optimization
   - Regular maintenance

---

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Daily**: Monitor logs, check backups
- **Weekly**: Review activity logs, check for issues
